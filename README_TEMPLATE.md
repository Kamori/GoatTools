# Goat Tools

## Purpose
This is a learning excercise. This is an attempt to recreate many common CLI tools in different languages. This aims to have a Test Driven Development focus. 

## Development Utils
* do_both - Runs your tool and the real tool at the sametime
   *  `do_both cat -n file.txt`
* goatgen - Based on [tools](tools.txt) generate details for maintaining the repo
   * `python utilities/goatgen.py --format markdown-table`  <-- Broken
